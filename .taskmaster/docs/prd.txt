# Overview  
Add a feature to the Gmail Unsubscriber app that allows users to minimize the "Processing Emails" dialog box. This enables viewing the dashboard and unsubscribing process/feedback in real time while processing continues in the background.

# Core Features  
- Minimize button on the processing dialog.
- Minimized state shows a small indicator or toast with progress.
- Ability to restore the full dialog.
- Real-time updates to the dashboard during processing.

# User Experience  
- Target users: Gmail users unsubscribing from emails.
- Flow: Start processing, minimize dialog, view dashboard updates, restore if needed.
- UI: Add minimize icon/button to the dialog.

# Technical Architecture  
- Modify frontend JavaScript (likely app.js) to handle minimize/restore.
- Use CSS for minimized state.
- Ensure backend processing continues independently.
- WebSocket or polling for real-time updates if not already implemented.

# Development Roadmap  
- Phase 1: Implement minimize functionality for the dialog.
- Phase 2: Ensure real-time dashboard updates.
- Phase 3: Test and refine UI/UX.

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Update UI components first.
- Implement minimize logic.
- Integrate with existing processing code.

# Risks and Mitigations  
- Risk: Interfering with processing logic.
- Mitigation: Keep UI changes separate from backend.
- Risk: Performance issues with real-time updates.
- Mitigation: Optimize update frequency.
